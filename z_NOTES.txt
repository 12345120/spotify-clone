- props.children --> built-in
- props can be passed in destructuring assignment 
export const StateProvider = ({ reducer, initialState, children}) => (
  <StateContext.Provider value={useReducer(reducer, initialState)}> 
    {children}
  </StateContext.Provider>
)
--> here, {children} is part of the built-in props

- Slider (Mui component)
- Grid (Mui component)
  - xs={12} or just xs (bc there's a default val)
  - specify attributes within tag (how Grid of Mui works) 
  
  

/* "!important" used here bc they are Mui icons?
makes sense bc just like <Link> has the greatest specificity,
